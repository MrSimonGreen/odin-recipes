<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Spooky season pumpkins no waste tasty creamy belly</p>
<h2><ul>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion - finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic - crushed</li>
    <li>500g pumpkin or squash - peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>50-100ml whole milk</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato puree</li>
    <li>2 tbsp mascarpone</li>
    <li>250g shot pasta</li>
    <li>40g grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
<h2><ol>Steps:</h2>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large, shallow, flameproof casserole or frying pan over a low-medium heat and fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 10-15 mins until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for 1 min more. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook the pumpkin in a pan of boiling salted water for 10-15 mins until tender when pierced with a cutlery knife. Drain and tip into a blender (or use a hand blender). Blitz with 50ml milk and the onions until completely smooth, gradually adding more milk until the mixture is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon (you may not need all the milk). Tip into a large frying pan with the tomato pur√©e and mascarpone, and bring to a simmer over a low heat.</li>
    <li>Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling, salted water following pack instructions. Drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Toss the pasta with the pumpkin sauce, parmesan and 50-100ml of the reserved water to loosen. Season and scatter with extra parmesan.</li>
