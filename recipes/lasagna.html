<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Lasagna is so delicious, no wonder it's Garfield's favourite!</p>
<h2><ul>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>Minced beef</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion - diced</li>
    <li>1/2 large bell pepper - diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic - minced</li>
    <li>1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 glug of red wine</li>
    <li>A sprinkle of Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>Lots of cheese!</li></ul>
<h2><ol>Steps:</h2>
    <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with minced beef, bell peppers, onions,
        and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
        The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong>
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the
        mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles,
        more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers
        and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li></ol>
