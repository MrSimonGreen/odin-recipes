<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Apple Jam made with apples all jammy like mmm</p>
<h2><ul>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>1kg Bramley apples - peeled, cored and chopped</li>
    <li>250g caster sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 lemon - juiced</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li></ul>
<h2><ol>Steps:</h2>
    <li>Put a small plate in the freezer. Tip the chopped apple and caster sugar into a large saucepan along with 350ml of water and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar.</li>
    <li>Cook gently, stirring regularly, for 30 mins until the apples have collapsed.</li>
    <li>Stir in the lemon juice, add the cinnamon stick and simmer gently for another 2-3 mins until the mixture is thick and glossy.</li>
    <li>Remove the small plate from the freezer and drop a little of the mix onto it. Leave for a few seconds – it should be fairly firm. If it’s still a little runny, put the pan back of the heat and simmer for another 10-15 mins. Put the plate back in the freezer and test again, it should now be ready.</li>
    <li>Divide between clean, sterilised jars and seal. <em>Will keep for three months in a cool, dry place.</em> Once opened, chill and use within one month</li></ol>
